# Game of Life

Wikipedia description: The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

### Code
Run the code with Python 3 or more recent and it will ask the user to input a positive integer N to create an N by N grid. The grid will be initialized and each cell starts out as alive with probability p_born, which the user can choose.

Frankly, [Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net/) is much superior and I would recommend playing around with it if you haven't already!
